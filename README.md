# AMQ 7 Sample Running on OpenShift 3

Four pods, 2 for each interconnect router and one pod for the 2 master brokers and another
pod for 2 slave brokers. For this test, security, autolinks and jgroups were disabled. 

The pods were designed using a dockerfile template using fedora 26.
Additionally 4 yaml files were designed to be used as S2i templates to be processed by 
OpenShift when building the images for the pods:

“amq_image_template.yaml”: Base image for fedora 26, brokers, and routers.

“amq_a_template.yaml”: Template for master brokers and their configs.

“amq_b_template.yaml”: Template for slave brokers and their configs.

“amq_interconnect_template.yaml”: Template for interconnect routers and their configs.

After proper deployment of the corresponding pods in OpenShift, we were able to see the 
master brokers finding their slaves and routers communicating with brokers.
